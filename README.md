# Customer-Churn-Analysis-Dashboard

Goal: To identify at-risk customers, uncover key churn drivers, and provide actionable recommendations to improve customer retention using visual analytics and behavioral segmentation.

Description:
This project focused on analyzing customer churn behavior using a telecom dataset in Power BI. The dataset included customer demographics, service usage, billing preferences, and support interactions. The workflow involved cleaning and transforming the data (e.g., creating tenure and monthly charge bins), calculating churn rates and averages with DAX measures, and visualizing trends across tenure, support tickets, contracts, and payment methods. Key dashboards were built to highlight churn distribution, service-related risk factors, and high-value customer segments.

Results:
The dashboard revealed that month-to-month contract holders, fiber optic users, and customers paying via electronic check had the highest churn. Customers with little or no support history also showed early churn behavior. The insights led to data-backed strategies like promoting annual contracts, targeting support outreach, and optimizing billing options to retain at-risk customers.
